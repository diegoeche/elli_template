=============

A simple template project to help you getting started creating Erlang Web
servers with tests and environment-based configurations.

## Getting Started ##

    git clone git://github.com/diegoeche/elli_template.git
    cd elli_template
    rebar get-deps && rebar compile && deps/etest/bin/etest-runner

Congratulations! You have just created, compiled and tested your application.
